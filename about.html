                <h1 class="about-title">Our Story & Commitment</h1>
                <p>The Cozy Crumb was founded on a simple belief: that the best bread is baked with time, love, and the highest quality ingredients. What started as a small, local bakery with a focus on sourdough has grown into a community staple, but our commitment to artisanal methods remains unchanged.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-title">What Makes Us Special?</h2>
                <p>We pride ourselves on our slow-fermentation process, which develops deep, complex flavors you won't find in mass-produced baked goods. Every loaf, pastry, and cake is handcrafted daily by our dedicated team of bakers. We source locally whenever possible, supporting our community and ensuring peak freshness.</p>
